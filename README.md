# FilesynchronizationLabs: Optimized Delta-Based File Synchronization Engine
Optimizing file synchronization with Merkle trees and multi-threaded incremental hash computations.

The FilesynchronizationLabs repository provides an optimized delta-based file synchronization engine that leverages Merkle trees and multi-threaded incremental hash computations to efficiently synchronize files between systems. This Rust-based engine is designed to minimize network bandwidth and reduce synchronization times, making it ideal for large-scale file synchronization applications.

The FilesynchronizationLabs engine is built to tackle the challenges of file synchronization in modern distributed systems. With the proliferation of cloud storage and collaborative workflows, the need for efficient file synchronization has become increasingly important. Traditional file synchronization approaches often rely on simplistic byte-level comparison or hashing, which can lead to excessive network traffic and slow synchronization times. By utilizing Merkle trees and multi-threaded incremental hash computations, the FilesynchronizationLabs engine provides a more efficient and scalable solution for file synchronization.

The engine's design is centered around the concept of delta-based synchronization, where only the differences between file versions are transmitted over the network. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data transferred and enables faster synchronization times. The engine's use of Merkle trees allows for efficient incremental hashing, enabling the detection of changes at the block level rather than the file level. This approach enables the engine to identify and transmit only the changed blocks, further reducing network traffic.

The FilesynchronizationLabs engine provides numerous benefits for developers and system administrators, including reduced network bandwidth consumption, faster synchronization times, and improved scalability. By leveraging the power of Rust and advanced algorithmic techniques, the engine provides a reliable and efficient solution for file synchronization in modern distributed systems.

## Installation

To install the FilesynchronizationLabs engine, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust and Cargo on your system: https://rustup.rs/
2. Clone the FilesynchronizationLabs repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/FilesynchronizationLabs.git`
3. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd FilesynchronizationLabs`
4. Build the engine using Cargo: `cargo build --release`
5. Run the engine: `target/release/filesynchronizationlabs`

## Configuration

The FilesynchronizationLabs engine can be configured using environment variables and settings files. The following environment variables can be set:

* `FSYNC_LOG_LEVEL`: sets the logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
* `FSYNC_THREAD_COUNT`: sets the number of threads used for incremental hash computations
* `FSYNC_MERKLE_TREE_DEPTH`: sets the depth of the Merkle tree

Additionally, the engine can be configured using a settings file (`fsync_settings.toml`) with the following options:

* `log_level`: sets the logging level
* `thread_count`: sets the number of threads used for incremental hash computations
* `merkle_tree_depth`: sets the depth of the Merkle tree

## Usage

The FilesynchronizationLabs engine provides a command-line interface for synchronizing files. To synchronize two files, use the following command:

`filesynchronizationlabs sync file1.txt file2.txt`

This command will synchronize the two files, transmitting only the differences between the files. The engine can also be used programmatically via its API. For API documentation, see the `docs/api` directory.
